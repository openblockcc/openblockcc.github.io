Fix bug After loading a new project file, the connection of the old device is not disconnected. After loading a new project file, if the project does not have a device extension, the code area will be empty. When connecting to a device without fimata service, there will be no alert prompt to download the firmware. Optimize the firmata communication architecture in real-time mode to fix some potential problems. Fixed the misspelled device configuration name from leanMore to learnMore. Fixed the inaccurate meaning of Arduino block name from whole number to integer. Fixed the problem that Microbit V2 failed to download the firmware when it failed to enter the REPL. v2.2.7 \u00b6 Fix bug After loading the project file, save the project file again and load it, there will be an error and the project cannot be loaded. After loading the project file, click the new project button, and the interface will crash. When opening the extension interface in upload mode, it will freeze for 1~2 seconds before the extension options are loaded. ## v2.2.6 Fix bug The newline parameter of arduino mega2560 serial send block does not take effect. After creating a new sprite, the device selection is cleared. An error occurs after load a project file that contains multiple device extensions. v2.2.5 \u00b6 Fix bug Because shield in openblock-resource source code is misspelled as sheild, shield filter in GUI interface is null. In VM, one more line of startheartbeat function call is written, and startheartbeat repeats reentry, resulting in real-time communication error. Add rtscts flow control configuration to repair the situation that some three-party compatible boards cannot be used when opening rtscts flow control. Cannot edit input-box after the alert or confirm window pops up. The device selection is not cleared after a new project is created. The old device is not disconnected after a new project is created. v2.2.4 \u00b6 Fix bug There is no A0 ~ A5 option for the read digital pin blocks of control boards such as Arduino UNO. After using the shortcut key Ctrl + Z to modify blocks, the code on the right side is not updated. v2.2.3 \u00b6 Fix bug When you double-click to open the project file with the selected device, an error will occur in loading. After add comment for device extension block and save the project file. If try to load the project after restart the software, there is another comment window appear which cannot able to delete. v2.2.2 \u00b6 New feature Optimize the font and line break display effect of the serial terminal. Display the loaded extensions first in the extensions library. Modify the default serial port configuration of esp8266 to the official default 76800. Modify the esp8266 upload rate to 921600 to speed up the upload speed. Fix bug When loading a project with a extension, an error will be reported and cannot be loaded. The input box of the variable increase block is parsed incorrectly when other blocks or variables are placed. In the even sprite, the movement blocks in the toolbox area will not automatically change to the coordinates of the character's current position. Fix the problem that esp32 and esp8266 cannot start after clicking the reset button when connecting to openblock due to the lack of serial port to enable dtr rts flow control. After connecting and disconnecting the device once in upload mode, no matter what mode is connected to the device again, it will not be able to establish communication with the connection firmata. ESP32 and ESP8266 will get stuck for a long time between compiling and uploading. v2.2.1 \u00b6 Fix bug The data sent by the serial port is incorrect. Sometimes the project file cannot be opened by double-click or cannot be loaded due to an error when loading the project. Duplicate loading of projects after connecting devices can cause multiple real-time mode listeners to start causing errors. v2.2.0 \u00b6 New feature Add Kit filter option to device selection. Add the option to cancel the device selection. When loading a project containing unknown devices and plug-ins, the error details will be reported. Update the device picture according to the new picture standard. Automatically obtain the control board pin list in external extensions. Add slider type blocks. Optimized the devil bird svg image. Add back edit menu. Fix bug The serial port send button is collapsed in small window mode. Modify the default installation path of the desktop version of windows to the root directory of C drive instead of the deep directory of user data. If there is an unsupported device id in the external device list, the device model will be empty. Because the vm building block adds the device type in front of the optype, the display variable cannot be translated normally. Esp8266 digital pin cannot select GPIO16. Check the checkbox so that the variable will be displayed in the stage area, and it will still exist after switching the device. Arduino ceil function name error. The microbit attitude option is not translated. Microbit uses multiple while true statements that are not supported. When using the scroll wheel to move the toolbox, the completely displayed blocks beyond the boundary are blocked again. Color picker function is not available. The disconnection error alert flashes after switching the mode. When using a third-party device, the alert uses the mother board instead of the picture of the third-party device board. Error when load device in no target but has variable. v2.1.1 \u00b6 New feature Add esp8266 and makey makey support. Add a button to show all connectable device. Prevent users from being unable to connect to the device when using a USB-to-serial chip that is not included. Add file associations for .ob project file. Fix bug Severe freeze after switching targets several times. The remote resource update address configuration error caused the program to crash after clicking the Check Update button. The remote resource update address incorrectly uses openblockcc instead of the address in the configuration. When the blocks nested inside the blocks in the toolbox are in the workspace, the internal blocks are erroneously disabled when the disabled state is updated. An error is reported after opening multiple windows: the address is already in use. v2.1.0 \u00b6 New feature Change arduino build tool from arduino-builder to arduino-cli. Add remote upgrade function for external extension and device. Modify the default sprite to Demon Bird. Add arduino esp32 board support. Add microbit V2 board support. Add clear cache button.

Optimize the serialport framwork. Prevent interface freeze caused by receiving high-speed serialport data. Add QDP ROBOT C02 kit(arduino esp32). Fix bug Stuck at the upload modal if unplug the usb cable while in arduino build progress. Unplug the usb cable while in arduino upload progress, the gui does not disconnect the device. User could still click the upload button and then will stuck in upload modal. Uploading the program or firmware after connecting and disconnecting the device several times will cause the real-time mode communication bug. After the upload is successful, if user do not close the upload window, unplug the usb cable, it will display upload failure. v2.0.0 \u00b6 New feature Add serilport console. Separate third party device from bundle pack. now support modify third party device without rebuild the project. Optimize the block's disable logic in different programming modes. Now in realtime mode, you can select the realtime mode extension. If a block is not connected into the effective tree. it's setup and define and others code will not generate. Optimize the structure of the code generated by Arduino code generator to make it more consistent with Arduino native code format. The project file will save the current programming mode and automatically switch to the saved mode after loading. In programming mode, blocks can no longer be click executed and glow. After the realtime mode communication is successfully established, there will be no atert. Instead, it will indicate whether the communication is successful by dimming the communication icon on the right side of the connection icon. A alter will pop up and prompt to download the real-time mode firmware only after the communication attempt fails. After the firmware is downloaded and the real-time communication is established successfully, the alert of real-time mode failure warning will automatically disappear. Fix bug When loading a project file with multiple large extensions, the toolbar area will repeatedly display the contents of multiple extensions, and some other errors. The button to download firmware is not disabled when there is no connected device. Shorten the window of upload to fix the problem of incomplete display on some pc. Fixed a number of potential problems with realtime mode communication. The code window is not re rendered after resizing, resulting in a missing display. After switching programming mode, the sprite will disappear in some times. Arduino and microbit do not hide all the unsupported building blocks in programming mode. Microbit's buttonIsPressed block transcoding function should have written n for b when button is B. Microbit custom variable name exception. Arduino UNO mega2560 serial port 0 translation code is incorrect. Number parsing error of data_changevariableby block.
